# mu-sybscit-core-java-practicals

Hello everyone, I am a former student of Mumbai University college, India.
In my Second Year of BSc IT, I experienced that how difficult is to find practicals of my syllabus, so I decided to make them easily accessible. This is my first repository in this goal and will be making more for each subject.

This repository is made in hope to help students of Mumbai University (and associated colleges).
