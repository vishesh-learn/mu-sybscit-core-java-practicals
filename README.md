# Mumbai University SYBScIT Core Java Practicals

Welcome to the Mumbai University SYBScIT Core Java Practicals repository! This repository is created to help students of Mumbai University and its associated colleges find practicals for their Core Java course.

As a former student of Mumbai University, I understand how difficult it can be to find practicals for the syllabus. This repository aims to make it easier for students to access Core Java practicals.

Please note that the Java version used in this repository is `jdk1.8.0_231`. While this may be an older version, it is the version recommended by the syllabus.

Currently, this repository does not contain any AWT-based practicals.
